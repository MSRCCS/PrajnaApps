    <h1>Image Describer</h1>
    <p>The Image Describer bot allows the user to find more information about the image. After they attach an image or send an image URL, they can ask the bot questions relating to what is going on in the image, emotion, attributes of people in it (age, celebrity), and for similar images. For more information, ask the bot "what can you do".</p>
